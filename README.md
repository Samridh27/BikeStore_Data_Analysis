# Bike Stores Data Analysis
This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow, from data extraction and transformation using SQL to data visualization and dashboard creation using Excel and Tableau. The analysis is based on the "Bike Stores" dataset, which contains information about sales, customers, products, and stores.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to leverage key data analysis tools to derive meaningful insights from the Bike Stores dataset. The project follows a typical data pipeline:

- Data Extraction & Structuring: Used SQL to create a relational database schema and load raw data.

- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Utilized Excel to clean, transform, and pivot the data for analysis.

- Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards in both Excel and Tableau to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and business insights.

# Technologies Used
- Excel: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and creating a preliminary dashboard.

- SQL: Employed to create the database schema, load the data, and perform initial data querying.

- Tableau: Utilized to build an interactive and comprehensive dashboard for more advanced data visualization.

# Files in this Repository
- BikeStores.xlsx: The main dataset used in this project, containing sales, customer, and product information.

- BikeStores Sample Database - create objects.sql: SQL script to create the necessary tables and schemas for the Bike Stores database.

- BikeStores Sample Database - drop all objects.sql: SQL script to drop all database objects, useful for resetting the environment.

- BikeStores Sample Database - load data.sql: SQL script to populate the tables with data from the dataset.

- Book1.twb: The Tableau workbook file containing the final data visualizations and dashboard.

# Key Insights from the Dashboard
The dashboards created in this project provide a comprehensive view of the business's performance. Some of the key insights include:

- Sales Performance: Analysis of sales trends over time, including monthly and yearly revenue.

- Top Customers: Identification of the highest-spending customers.

- Product Analysis: Insights into the best-selling products, brands, and categories.

- Geographic Sales: A breakdown of sales by city and state to identify top-performing regions.

- Store and Staff Performance: Evaluation of sales performance for each store and individual sales representatives.

# Getting Started
- Setup the Database: Use a SQL environment (like SQL Server Management Studio) to run the create objects.sql and load data.sql scripts to set up the database and load the data.
- Explore the Data in Excel: Open the BikeStores.xlsx file to see the cleaned data and the initial Excel-based dashboard.
- View the Tableau Dashboard: The Book1.twb file can be opened with Tableau to view the interactive dashboard.
